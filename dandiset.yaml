description: 'Spiking activity and simultaneously recorded fluorescence signals in
  transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6


  We present a dataset consisting of simultaneously measured fluorescence and spiking
  activity of pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of primary visual cortex in transgenic
  mouse lines expressing genetically-encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) GCaMP6s or
  GCaMP6f.
